# Crime-in-Philadelphia

The recent fast growth of sharing economy has attracted attentions of many
studies. As the leading platform in accommodation and lodging services, Airbnb
and its influence in neighborhood is important for urban policy making. In this
paper, we study whether the introducing of Airbnb to neighborhoods would af-
fect local safety, which is an important indicator of the life quality. We focus on
Philadelphia as an example, with data of more than 6 thousand Airbnb listings
and 10 year's crime data. Statistical methods, such as regression discontinuity
analysis, are applied on the block group level. Our analyses show that Airbnb
does not affect crime in a pre-specified neighborhood of the unit.
